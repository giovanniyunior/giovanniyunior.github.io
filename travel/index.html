                <h4>Luisa</h4>
                <p>One of the best places that I`ve visited in Iguazu was the waterfalls. I went with my family and my boyfriend. I enjoyed the landscape, animals, plants, etc. Everything was amazing. Of course, we walked a lot. The natural reserve is full of stairs and wonderful roads. We also saw some animals such as monkeys and meerkats. I hope that you can visit it, you will enjoy the trip.</p>
