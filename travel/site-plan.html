          There is magic in this city, the people have a lot of energy and happiness, the old town is fantastic and romantic, I recommend visiting for your honeymoon, it's amazing, I also visit some islands close to the city. The water is transparent and you can snorkel.

        One of the best places that I`ve visited in Iguazu was the waterfalls. I went with my family and my boyfriend. I enjoyed the landscape, animals, plants, etc. Everything was amazing. Of course, we walked a lot. The natural reserve is full of stairs and wonderful roads. We also saw some animals such as monkeys and meerkats. I hope that you can visit it, you will enjoy the trip.
